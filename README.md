# Python-NutritionTracker
## Project Description
College Project: A nutrition tracker: Takes user inputs, saves, and displays daily nutritional values.
 * Simply run the .exe file to execute the program
 * Code can be viewed in the NutritionTracker.py files


## Additional Info
This is an update to my 2018 Python Project from college where I have converted the .py into an .exe file using PyInstaller.
