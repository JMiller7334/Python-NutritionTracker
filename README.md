# Python-NutritionTracker
## Project Description
College Project: A nutrition tracker: Takes user input. The program saves and displays daily nutritional values for each day based on what was entered by the user.
 * Simply run the .exe file to execute the program
 * Code can be viewed in the NutritionTracker.py file


## Additional Info
This is an update to my 2018 Python Project from college where I have converted the .py into an .exe file using PyInstaller.
